==================== Autoloader ====================

==================== Coding Standard ====================
- use <?php / ?> tag or <?= / ?> tag
- use utf-8 without BOM
- a file should either declare new symbols(classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side effects, but *NOT* both
- class names: StudlyCaps
- class constants: ALL_UPPER
- method name: camelCase

==================== Coding Style ====================
- indent using 4 space, not tabs
- line length: 0~80 always ok, 80~120 acceptable, 120+ linter must show a warning
- one space after `namespace` declaration, one space after `use` declaration
- opening braces for class and methods must go on the next line(I hate this, too)
- opening braces for control structures must go on the same line
- opening/closing parenthses for control structures must not have a space after/before them
- visibility must be delcared, `abstract` and `final` must before visibility, `static` must after
- constrol structure keywords must have one space after them, method and function call must not
-*file must be UNIX LF line ending, end with a single blak line, and omit closing ?> if is pure PHP
- there must not be a trailing space at the end of non-blank lines
- there must not be more than one statement per line
-*keywords must be in lower case(including `true`, `false`, `null`)
- property and method name should *NOT* be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private
- in the argument list, there must not be a space before each comma, must be after comma
-*the arguments with defualt value must go at the end of the argument list
- if argument list splited into multiple line, subsequent line is indented once, and one argument per line, and the wrapping parenthesis must be on their own line
- use `elseif` instead of `else if`
-*when use `switch`, if there is a intentional fall-through in a non-empty `case` body, there must be a comment `// no break`
