Q:
    character vs character constant vs string vs string constant
    single quote vs double quote
IRC:
    <UniFreak> when K&R say `constant`, can I understand it as `literal` ?
    <kamog> UniFreak: yeah, it looks like they mean literals.


Every program must have a main function

A sequence of characters in double quotes, like  "hello, world\n" , is called a character
string or string constant

All variables must be declared before they are used

char int short long float double

By definition,  char s are just small integers

'\n' is a single character

A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. This is called a character constant, although it is just another way to write a small integer. So, for example,  'A' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65, the internal representation of the character A. Of course,  'A' is to be preferred over  65 : its meaning is obvious, and it is independent of a particular character set.

Integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded

Writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values
emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers
