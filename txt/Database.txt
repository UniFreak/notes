==================== Design ====================
Granularity
    never store calculated data, you should be able to caculate it using current stored data
Naming
    underscore or camelCase are all fine, just be consistent
    singular or plural table name are all fine, just be consistent
    prefix or non-prefix table name are all fine, just be consistent
    PK can be simply id or somethingId, just be consistent(I chose simply id)
Normalizng
    1st Normal Form
        make sure there is primary key
        and don't have multiple value inside one column
    2nd Normal Form
        ???
    3rd Normal Form
        move transitive dependency into seperate table
        and associate it with original table using table key
Relationship
    foreign key benefits? integrity
    foreign key must be set on unique or primary key values

    one to many(foreign key)
    many to many(junction table & foreign key)
Workflow
    write down use case
    identify the nouns(sometime verbs)
    identify the relationships
    create the tables
