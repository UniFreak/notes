class naming
	class
		first char must be letter
		use UpperCamelCase naming
		file convention: class.ClassName.inc
	property & method
		first char must be letter
		use lowerCamelCase naming
		use _ if it is not public
		default value must not depend on runing time 
	constant
		ALL_CAPITAL_SEPERATED_BY_UNDERSCORE
scope
	public: for api
	protected: for internal use
	private: least common
magic method
	list:
		__autoload($className)

		__get($name)
		__set($name, $value)
		__construct()
		__toString()
		__clone()
	why use:
		trigger customer behavior when event happen
		customize object creation
		defaults like current time
	why not use:
		3-20 times slower method call
		ignores scope(all is public), meaning can accidentally expose unpublic data
	decide for yourself
why static:
	single connection for databases or services
	avoids need for global scope(before PHP 5.3)
	single instance of class
why constant:
	for properties that never change
		- error codes
		- data structure names
overriding:
	constants
		- just redeclare
		- but can't redeclare constant defined in interface
	methods
		- must have same number of arguments(except constructor)
		- can call parent class methods and properties
build-in class
	stdClass
	Exception
design-pattern
	singleton: restrict instantiation to one object
		- Database class
		- ? LazyInit ?
	factory: create object without specifying exact class
	strategy:
		- family of algorithms to perform a task
		- mechanism to determin which algorithm to use
	?gateway?
	ORM

?var_export?
