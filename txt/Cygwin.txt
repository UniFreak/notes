using 163 repos:
http://mirrors.163.com/cygwin/

use XShell to access Cygwin:

1. Install cygwin, and install sshd. (With openssh-related are selected ^^)
2. Open the cygwin console: Enter ssh-host-config, all the way yes (if vista or win7, need to right click -> Run as administrator cygwin).
Part of the screen:

$ Ssh-host-config
Overwrite existing / etc / ssh_config file? (Yes / no) yes
Generating / etc / ssh_config file
Overwrite existing / etc / sshd_config file? (Yes / no) yes
Privilege separation is set to yes by default since OpenSSH 3.3.
However, this requires a non-privileged account called 'sshd'.
For more info on privilege separation read /usr/share/doc/openssh/README.privsep.

Should privilege separation be used? (Yes / no) yes
Generating / etc / sshd_config file

Host configuration finished. Have fun!
3. Tip the installation was successful. Cygwin console input net start sshd, ssh service started.
$ Net start sshd
CYGWIN sshd service is starting.
CYGWIN sshd service has started successfully.
4. Modify the default Administrator password

$ Passwd Administrator

5. Use XShell connection localshot, user name and password for the Administrator password
