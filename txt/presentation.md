# Slides
- Minimize the number of slides
- should convey information that can’t otherwise be understood without the visual
- should explain to the group your proposal, idea, problem, or current status in a way that uses graphs, charts, or visual depictions of abstraction 
- __eliminate__ all the slides that are bullet lists of your talking points
- **Never ever read your slides**, You’re there to explain, expand, answer questions, and lead them logically through your material
- Lose the template. remove anything that’s meaningless color, swoopy swirlies, logos, and artistic doodads
- when you’re not referencing slides, turn them off using `b` key


# You
- If you’re interested, and you’ll be interesting
- If you’re enthusiastic or optimistic about the topic you’re presenting, let that come through, both in the __expression on your face__ and in __your voice__, in __what you say__ (“We’re pretty excited about this”)
- Prepare: at least the the first thing you say. and all the thing that's complicated
- Practice aloud, every word, phrase, and turn of the head
