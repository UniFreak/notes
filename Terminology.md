# CGI: Common Gateway Interface

Each `web server` runs a `HTTP server software` (like nginx). It can serve static contents from a local file directory, or it can serve dynamic content generated by `scripts` (like php or perl scripts, ie `web application`).

To generate dynamic contents, HTTP server software needs to pass infomation (like to user inputs) to scripts, and scripts needs to return infomation required by HTTP server software (like HTTP status, document type).

Initially, different server software use differenct way to exchange info with scripts, so it's hard to reuse the scripts in another server software without modification.

So `CGI` is made, as an protocal (standard way) interfacing between server software and scripts. Scripts operate according to CGI standard is called `CGI scripts` or `CGIs`.

`CGIs` often is stored inside `cgi-bin/` folder.

Calling CGIs often involve creating new process, this is time-comsuming and limits resource reuse techniques (such as reusing database connections, in-memory caching, etc).

# FastCGI

Variation of CGI, uses persistent processes to handle a series of requests

# SCGI: Simple CGI

Similar to FastCGI but is designed to be easier to parse

# WSGI: Web Server Gateway Interface

A simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications or frameworks written in the __Python__ programming language.

# JSGI: Javascript Web Server Gateway Interface

# PSGI: Perl Web Server Gateway Interface (Plack)

# Rack: Ruby Webserver interface
