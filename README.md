Here is all the notes I made while learning, including varies of kind of things, but mostly are coding-related technologies

I tend to make note in plain text file while reading, bacause of its universal availability and easy to search ( I just open sublime-text, ctrl+alt+p to switch to my `note` project, then ctrl+f to find what I'm looking for). those original `.txt` file are in the `raw/` folder, they may mixed with Chinese and English.

But to make the note more readable online, I transform those raw note into markdown, and translated them from mixed language into seperated Chinese version and English version. those markdown file are all in `md/` folder, resided either in `md/cn/` or `md/en`.

I keep these note mostly as a reference (looking up using sublime-text like I said before). Those notes are not "learning material". say if you havn't learn markdown language, then the note `markdown.md` may make no sense to you. To summary, there notes are just a reference, a reminder the the "whole thing". It helped me to reminde something while I'm coding, if it help you, too, I'll be very pleased.

The content of my note come from varies of resources(website, book, irc channel chat or live person communication). I only did the work of organizing them in a structured way.
