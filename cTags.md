# Concepts

run on all files in either a single directory (e.g. `ctags *`), or on all files in an entire source directory tree (`ctags −R`), only those files whose names are mapped to languages will be scanned

etags mode: which will create a tag file for use with the Emacs editor.

# Usage

For a complete list of supported languages, the names by which they are recognized `−−list−languages`

the kinds of tags which are generated for each, `−−list−kinds`

each language may be display using the `−−list−maps` option and may be changed using the `−−langmap` option
