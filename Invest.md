bottom line
    - don't waste your time and money trying to beat the market
    - a stock price is like a coin flip - wrong but fair
    - making a corporation pay more taxes is just another way of making people pay more taxes
    - the longer you're in the market, the bigger the potential losses and gains in dollar terms
    - you can't make much money if you miss the handful of best trading days of the year
    - we simply don't know everything about why stock prices move
    - you can play safe, or you can try for big returns, but competition won't let you have both
    - stock returns and risk premium give us an estimate of what we want to know, not exactly what we want to know

good sense
    - assume that the price of stock is fair - not overvalued or undervalued
    - get your financial house in order before you invest in stocks
    - don't confuse managers who control the goodies with the goodies themselves
    - there is a difference between a bad deal and a good deal that turns out badly

The main reason to start investing as soon as you can is that time is one of the three big factors that determine how much you have at the end of your investment horizon. The other two are how much you invest and the rate of return on your investments. within those three factor, you only can control the time and the `how much`

You'll capture most of the benefits of diversification by the time you're holding about 15 stocks
If you’re holding only two stocks, you’re better off choosing them from different industries
