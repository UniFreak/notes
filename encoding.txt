- character repertoire: specifies a collection of characters, such as "a", "!", and "Ã¤"
- character code: defines numeric codes for characters in a repertoire
- character encoding: defines how sequences of numeric codes are presented as (i.e., mapped to) sequences of octets

- character set: might denotes just a character repertoire but it may also refer to a character code, and quite often a particular character encoding is implied too
- charset: is used to refer to an encoding
