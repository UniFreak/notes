# Concepts

## Rule

```sh
target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …
```

A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program. can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as ‘clean’

prerequisite is a file that is used as input to create the target

recipe is an action that make carries out. A recipe may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line.
NOTE: you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line!
(set the .RECIPEPREFIX variable to an alternate character)
