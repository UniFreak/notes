# Quesion
page jump?
html control?

# Basic
for **wireframe**: **mockups** or low-fidelity **prototype**

**project** contain many mockups and images,  use `.bmpr` file

`breakline` to indicate continuation

controls can be **converted** to another, avoid re-typing the content

**group** some controls to better align them or move them all at once

**crop** (mask) a group of controls to only show a selected portion of it?

you can add control by **drawing**

use **alternates** when:
- create only one mockup per screen but have several ideas about each one
- suggestions for design improvements but don't want other people changing your mockups
- send your project around for feedback and track each person's feedback individually
- try out new design ideas without including them in the mockups for the current release

you can switch to alternatives per mockup or per project

**markup**: a special kind of component in the UI Library that is used for adding annotations, comments, and explanatory notes

common markups: arrow/line, callout, stiky note, red x, curly braces

controls can be toggled to be treated as or not as markups

**Symbol** is a group of controls that represents a single piece of functionality

aka: **templates**, **master pages**, **custom components**, **widgets**, ...

to create symbol: group -> convert to symbol, now you can quick add them

**Symbol Library** is a collection of individual Symbols. It can be used as a way of grouping Symbols with similar purposes
