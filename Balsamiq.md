# Quesion
page jump?
html control?

# Basic
for wireframe: mockups or low-fidelity prototype

project contain many mockups and images,  use `.bmpr` file

`breakline` to indicate continuation

controls can be converted to another, avoid re-typing the content

group some controls to better align them or move them all at once

crop (mask) a group of controls to only show a selected portion of it?

you can add control by `drawing`

use `alternates` when:
- create only one mockup per screen but have several ideas about each one
- suggestions for design improvements but don't want other people changing your mockups
- send your project around for feedback and track each person's feedback individually
- try out new design ideas without including them in the mockups for the current release
