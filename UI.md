# Concepts

four different layers:

- Controls

concerned with the process and rationale of choosing controls

- Patterns

a group of controls that function to solve a particular problem

- Design Principles

CRAP

- Templates

behave predictably and look similar across the entire application

# UI Controls

## Input

button

- Set the button that a user is highly likely to select as the default (primary)
- Avoid using a button to mimic the behavior of other controls
- Use enough space between buttons so that users can click a specific one easily
- Avoid displaying an image in a standard button
- Use a verb or verb phrase and title-style capitalization for the button text
- Add an ellipsis to the title if the button immediately opens another window, dialog, or app to perform its action
- Separate destructive buttons from nondestructive controls
- Action should be immediate following a button press
- When several buttons are placed next to each other, ensure that they have the same width. This is particularly important for pairs of Cancel and OK buttons
- If pressing a button by mistake could cause a loss of data, do not set a default button
- Keep labels short, so they don't cause a button to use too much space. It is also important to consider how labels will change length when localized

text input

- Ensure that the length of a text input field comfortably accommodates the length of the expected input
- Text fields should indicate their state – whether enabled or disabled, empty or filled, valid or invalid – with a clear label, input, and assistive text
- Label text should be aligned with the input line, and always visible
- Label text shouldn’t take up multiple lines
- Placeholder text (also called hint text) can be used inside the input field (see the "Website" field below), but it shouldn't take the place of a label in a form, since it should disappear when the user starts typing. (Also see this note about accessibility of placeholder text
- Avoid breaking numbers with distinct sections (such as phone numbers, Social Security Numbers, or credit card numbers) into separate input fields.3 (Try using Input masks or flexible inputs instea
- For longer text, use a text area control (also called multi-line entry field), rather than a single line contro

dropdown (combobox)
